# Guess the Car Price ðŸš—
<br>
Welcome to "Guess the Car Price", a simple, fun game where car enthusiasts can test their car knowledge on car prices. Inspired by my lifelong passion for cars, this game challenges players to guess the MSRP of various cars, ranging from compact cars to super cars.<br><br>

### Overview
The game displays an image of a car, and playeres are prompted to guess its MSRP. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guess, with a maximum of 1,000 points for a perfect guess. The game consists of 9 rounds each, and the players will receive a total score at the end of the game.<br><br>

### Features
**Randomized Rounds** - Each game consists of 9 rounds with randomly selected cars to ensure a unique experience every time.<br>
**Scoring System** - Points are awarded based on the accuracy of their guess. The closer the guess to the actual price, the higher the score.<br>
**Interactive UI** - The user interface is minimal and user-friendly with intuitive controls.<br>
**Diverse Car Data** - The game includes a variety of cars, from everyday compact vehicles to one-off luxury supercars, to test the breadth of players' knowledge.<br><br>

### Inspiration
This game was heavily inspired by [The Auction Game](https://neal.fun/auction-game/) by Neal Agarwal. I wanted to create a similar experience tailored to car enthusiasts.<br><br>

### How to Play
1. Launch the game.
2. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
3. An image of a car will appear. Type in your guess of the displayed car's MSRP of its time.
4. Press the arrow button labeled ">" to submit your guess.
5. The actual MSRP of the car will show on top of the car image. Points are then awarded on how accurate your guess was.
6. Press the "Next" button to show the next car.
7. After completing 9 rounds, your total score will display. If you scored 9 perfect runs, your score should be 9,000.
8. Press "Play Again" to give it another shot, or press "Return to Start" to return to the starting screen.<br><br>
