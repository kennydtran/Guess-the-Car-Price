# Guess the Car Price ðŸš—
<br>
Welcome to "Guess the Car Price", a simple, fun game where car enthusiasts can test their car knowledge on car prices. Inspired by my lifelong passion for cars, this game challenges players to guess the MSRP of various cars, ranging from compact cars to super cars.<br><br>

### Overview
The game displays an image of a car, and playeres are prompted to guess its MSRP. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guess, with a maximum of 1,000 points for a perfect guess. The game consists of 9 rounds each, and the players will receive a total score at the end of the game.<br><br>

### Features
